Hello, I'm Fengyu Liu, a Ph.D. student in the System and Software Security Laboratory at Fudan University, advised by Prof. [Yuan Zhang](https://yuanxzhang.github.io/) and Prof. [Min Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UnKf9FIAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also the captain of Whitzard, a great CTF team at Fudan University.

My research interests includes **web security** and **LLM-based agent security**. To date, I have published 7 papers at top-tier international security conferences, including IEEE S&P, ACM CCS, and USENIX Security, with one receiving the Distinguished Paper Award at IEEE S&P 2025. Moreover, my research has been successfully adopted by leading companies such as Alibaba and Huawei, and acknowledged in security advisories by major tech companies including Apple, Microsoft, and Intel. It has also earned over $50,000 in security bounties.
